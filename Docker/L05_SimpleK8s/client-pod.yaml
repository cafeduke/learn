# The version number the config adheres to. Each version defines a set of k8s objects that are valid for the said version. 
# For example, apiVersion 'v1' allows objects like componentStatus, configMap, Pod, Event, Namespace, etc
apiVersion: v1

# The kind (broad classification type) of k8s object we are creating with 'this' configuration file.
# Note: Each configuration file creates one k8s object.
#
# Kind of k8s objects:
# ---------------------
# - Stateful
# - Replica Controller  
# - Pod                 : Used to run a container
# - Service             : Setup networking (Has 4 sub-types)
#   - ClusterIP
#   - NodePort          : Expose a container to outside world (For dev purpose only)
#   - LoadBalancer
#   - Ingress
kind: Pod

# The name of the pod 
#   - A object is identified by its "name" (Eg: kubectl describe <object-kind> <object-name>)
#   - Useful during logging
# One or more labels (tags) associated with this pod.
#   - NOTE: A label is a 'key:value' pair which are arbitrary (Any foo:bar will do). 
metadata:
  name: client-pod
  labels:
    component: web

# The spec (specification) of a Pod defines one or more tightly coupled (close knit) containers. 
#   - NOTE: Pod should have containers that cannot exist without the other. 
#     For example, server, backup manager (backup config), logger (backup logs).   
# The below config specifies an array of containers (Hence a '-' in the yaml). Each container has
#   - name         : Name of the conatiner. Containers running inside the single pod can use 'name' to reference.
#   - image        : The image location on docker-hub
#   - containerPort: Port value exposed for external clients (outside the node) like browser.
spec:
  containers:
    - name: client
      image: raghubs81/multi-web-server
      ports: 
        - containerPort: 3030
