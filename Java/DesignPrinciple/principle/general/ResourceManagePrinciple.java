/**
 * ResourceManager should not rely on finalize - An explicit terminator is a MUST. 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  - Finalize method is called when the object is garbage collected. 
 *  
 *  - There could be considerable delay b/w when the object is marked for 
 *    garbage collection (reference is made null) and when the object is garbage collected.
 *    
 *  - If the resource is crucial then the delay can in result in performance issues. 
 *    Furthermore, the behavior will be dependent on JVM implementation causing portability issues.
 *  
 *  - There is a severe performance penalty for using finalize(). So AVOID using it.   
 * 
 * ResourceManager MUST maintain the state of the object
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * ResourceMananger must maintain the state of the object. This is to throw an exception if any other method
 * is called after calling the "explicit terminator"
 * 
 * 
 * What does finalize do ?
 * ------------------------
 * Finalize just acts as a backup in the user forgets to call the "explicit terminator" method.
 * However, the Resource Manager MUST log an error to indicate that not calling the explicit 
 * terminator is actually a bug in the client's code.
