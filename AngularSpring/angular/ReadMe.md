# Introduction

[Angular](www.angular.io) is a framework for building applications supporting partial refresh

- Component based framework
- Clean separation of view templates and application logic
- Built-in support for data-binding and dependency injection (DI)
- Supports response web-design (Bootstrap, Google material design)

## Terminologies

| Term          | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Component     | Building block of angular application consisting of<br />A) View for user interface <br />B) Class containing application logic and event handling (events occurring on view) |
| View Template | HTML user interface for the component (with dynamic elements) |
| Directive     | Elements like conditionals and loop that alter view rendering |
| Service       | A class injected to provide a desired service like<br />- Retrieve data from a remote server<br />- Perform calculation<br />- Perform validation |
| Module        | A collection of components, directives, services and so on.  |

```

- Frontend: Angular HTML view components 
- Backend: A spring boot application that queries database
- A service uses REST API to get data. A service is injected into the component using Dependency Injection (DI) provided by Angular framework. Thus completing the full stack.

# Angular 

Angular Typescript (AngularTS) project needs node and node packages like typescript and angular

## Installation

### Packages to install

- First install NVM ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- Use NVM to install node `nvm install node` (This also installs NPM or Node PackageManager)
- NPM is used to install all packages
  - typescript `npm install -g typescript`
  - angular-cli `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### NG

NG refers to Angular Next Generation. The command `ng` provides the Angular CLI 

```bash
> ng version
     _                      _                 ____ _     ___
    / \   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|
   / △ \ | '_ \ / _` | | | | |/ _` | '__|   | |   | |    | |
  / ___ \| | | | (_| | |_| | | (_| | |      | |___| |___ | |
 /_/   \_\_| |_|\__, |\__,_|_|\__,_|_|       \____|_____|___|
                |___/
    


Angular CLI: 20.3.2
Node: 24.8.0
Package Manager: npm 11.6.0
OS: linux x64
    
Angular: <error>

Package                      Version

## Versions

### List all global versions

```bash

## Running Angular with HotServe

An angular app can be stared with a built-in custom serve that re-loads the app upon code changes (HotServe)

```bash
> cd learn/AngularSpring/angular/01-helloworld
> ng serve --port 7777
```

Make changes to `src/index.html` (under project root `01-helloworld`) and check the browser to see the changes reflected

## Overview of component workflow

**Workflow**

- The http://localhost:7777 loads `src/index.html`
- The `<app-root></app-root>` is a tag that needs to be rendered (Replaced by corresponding HTML code)
- There needs to be a class with an `@Component` decorator (Annotation in Java) having a `selector` that matches the tag `app-root`
- This component in `src/app/app.ts` defines the HTML and CSS files that shall be used by the rendering
- The HTML can further have dynamic elements that are resolved from `src/app/app.ts` such as `title`
