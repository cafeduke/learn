# K8s

# Setup

## Softwares
1) Kubernetes : A framework for container orchestration
2) KVM        : A virutal machine (VM) manager (KVM UI -- Virutal Machine Manager 2.2.1)
3) minikube   : A tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.  
                Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on our laptop.

# Core Elements

## K8s Object

An object is created from a k8s configuration file and has a specific purpose. Some objects (eg: Pod) abstract containers, some  objects monitor a container and other type of objects (eg: Service) setup networking.  

  - Each configuration file of k8s creates a 'K8s object' (A pod is just a type of object)
  - Following are few types of k8s objects -- Stateful, ReplicaController, Deployment, Pod and Service 

### Kinds (broad classification) of k8s objects

  - Stateful
  - Replica Controller  
  - Pod                   : Used to run a container
  - Service             : Setup networking (Has 4 sub-types)
    - ClusterIP
    - NodePort          : Expose a container to outside world (For dev purpose only)
    - LoadBalancer
    - Ingress

## K8s Master

  - Machines (or VMs) to manage worker nodes.
  - A master is responsible for maintaining the "desired state" specified by "Deployment"
    - A client tells a master about desired state (Like: number of copies of each pod)
    - The desired state of the client is captured (in an object called "Deployment")
    - The master distributes the pods among the available worker nodes (to maximise availability).
    - The master keeps polling the nodes, restart pods and makes sure the "desired state" is ALWAYS met.

## K8s Worker Node

Worker nodes are physical machines (or VMs) that are controlled by K8s master. 

- A worker node hosts one or more K8s objects.
- A worker node is gated by **kube-proxy**. 
- Any communication to the k8s node from outside world is via the kube-proxy.

## K8s client (kubectl)  
  - A client command line (CLI) tool to interact with the k8s master.

# Overview of k8s configuration file

## Pod

A pod is a commonly used k8s object. A pod encapsulates one or more cohesive containers (that do not make sense without the other). All containers of the pod must be on the same k8s node. A pod provides an abstraction of a node to its containers. A pod (much like a womb), acts as a node and abstracts its containers from rest of the world.

### Simple Pod configuration

```yaml
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Object Type : Pod
# Description : 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The version number the config adheres to. Each version defines a set of k8s objects that are valid for the said version. 
# For example, apiVersion 'v1' allows objects like componentStatus, configMap, Pod, Event, Namespace, etc
apiVersion: v1

# The kind (broad classification type) of k8s object we are creating with 'this' configuration file.
# Note: Each configuration file creates one k8s object.
#
# Kind of k8s objects:
# ---------------------
# - Stateful
# - Replica Controller  
# - Pod                 : Used to run a container
# - Service             : Setup networking (Has 4 sub-types)
#   - ClusterIP
#   - NodePort          : Expose a container to outside world (For dev purpose only)
#   - LoadBalancer
#   - Ingress
kind: Pod

# The name of the pod 
#   - A object is identified by its "name" (Eg: kubectl describe <object-kind> <object-name>)
#   - Useful during logging
# One or more labels (tags) associated with this pod.
#   - NOTE: A label is a 'key:value' pair which are arbitrary (Any foo:bar will do). 
metadata:
  name: web-server-pod
  labels:
    component: web

# The spec (specification) of a Pod defines one or more tightly coupled (close knit) containers. 
#   - NOTE: Pod should have containers that cannot exist without the other. 
#     For example, server, backup manager (backup config), logger (backup logs).   
# The below config specifies an array of containers (Hence a '-' in the yaml). Each container has
#   - name         : Name of the conatiner. Containers running inside the single pod can use 'name' to reference.
#   - image        : The image location on docker-hub
#   - containerPort: Port value exposed for external clients (outside the node) like browser.
spec:
  containers:
    - name: web-server
      image: raghubs81/multi-web-server
      ports: 
        - containerPort: 3030
```



## NodePort

A nodeport is a k8s service that exposes pods to other pods and/or outside world.  A NodePort is analogous to site-to-server mapping

```yaml
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Object Type : Service > NodePort
# Description : A service to expose pods to outside world and/or other pods. 
#               A NodePort is analogous to site-to-server mapping
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The version number the config adheres to. 
# Each version defines a set of k8s objects that are valid for the said version. 
apiVersion: v1

# The kind (broad classification type) of k8s object we are creating with 'this' configuration file.
# Note: Each configuration file creates one k8s object.
#
# Kind of k8s objects:
# ---------------------
#  - Stateful
#  - Replica Controller  
#  - Pod                 : Used to run a container
#  - Service             : Setup networking (Has 4 sub-types)
#    - ClusterIP
#    - NodePort          : Expose a container to outside world (For dev purpose only)
#    - LoadBalancer
#    - Ingress
#
# k8s node and kube-proxy
# -----------------------
#  - A k8s node is a machine (VM or physical).
#  - A k8s node can run/contain one or more Pods.
#  - A k8s node is gated by kube-proxy. Any communication to the k8s node from outside world is via the kube-proxy.
#
# k8s Service
# -----------
#  - A k8s node can run many services (Eg: NodePort service exposes the node of a pod)  
#  - The kubeproxy routes the request to the appropriate service.
#  - A NodePort service directs requests to object(s) (In this case Pod object)
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: web-server-node-port
  
spec:
  type: NodePort
  
  # port       : Port exposed for another k8s object inside our application (Internal listen port, for other k8s objects)
  # targetPort : Port targeted by this NodePort service (The origin-server port for this service)
  # nodePort   : Port exposed for outside world (External listen port, for outside world like browser)
  #              If not specified a random port in range 30000-32000 is assigned
  ports: 
    - port: 3050
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 31515

  # This service is associated with object(s). 
  # Which one(es)? -- All those having the key:value pairs 'component:web'
  selector:
    component: web
```



# Imperative Vs declarative approach

  - An imperative approach is to go to specific VM and/remote/update pods as required.
  - A declarative approach is to tell the K8s master of the desired state and let master do the dirty work.

## Imperative update: Modify container's image using kubectl apply

```bash
##
# Change the container image from "multi-web-server" to "multi-worker"
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
##
> git diff web-server-pod.yaml
diff --git a/Docker/L05_SimpleK8s/web-server-pod.yaml b/Docker/L05_SimpleK8s/web-server-pod.yaml
 spec:
   containers:
     - name: client
-      image: raghubs81/multi-web-server
+      image: raghubs81/multi-worker
       ports: 
         - containerPort: 3000

##
# Apply Objects
# --------------
##

# Apply says configured (not created) which means the existing object was updated with new config.
> kubectl apply -f web-server-pod.yaml
pod/web-server-pod configured

# Apply says created which means the existing object created.
> kubectl apply -f web-server-node-port.yaml
service/web-server-node-port created

##
# Get -- Status of object(s)
# --------------------------
##

## Imperative update: Modify container's port using kubectl apply

Certain properties can be modified using kubectl apply

```bash
##
# Change the container port
# -------------------------
##
> git diff web-server-pod.yaml
     - name: client
       image: raghubs81/multi-web-server
       ports: 
-        - containerPort: 3000
+        - containerPort: 3030

##
# Apply
# -----
# Apply fails 'port' field cannot be updated by 'apply' command
##
kubectl apply -f web-server-pod.yaml
The Pod "web-server-pod" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: pod updates may not change fields other than `spec.containers[*].image`, `spec.initContainers[*].image`, `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` or `spec.tolerations` (only additions to existing tolerations)
```

Certain properties can't be modified using kubectl apply. The number of containers, the name of container and port cannot be updated using kubectl apply

```bash
spec:
  containers:                               # Can't add/del containers using 'kubectl apply'
    - name: client                          # Can't modify name using 'kubectl apply'
      image: raghubs81/multi-web-server     # Image CAN be updated  
      ports: 
        - containerPort: 3030               # Can't modify using 'kubectl apply'
```

## Imperative delete: Modify container's port using kubectl delete

The delete command gives 10s for the pod to perform pre-exit operations before it is forcefully removed.

```bash
> kubectl delete -f web-server-pod.yaml 
pod "web-server-pod" deleted
```

# Services

A k8s master manages several k8s worker nodes. 

## Worker Node and KubeProxy

- A k8s node is a machine (VM or physical).

- A k8s node can run/contain one or more Pods.

- A k8s node is gated by kube-proxy. Any communication to the k8s node from outside world is via the kube-proxy. The kube-proxy routes to a service object.

-  A Service (sub-type NodePort) k8s object uses the configured **selector** (In this case 'component:web') to find all k8s objects which have this tag/label. The service objects shall route requests to all matching k8s objects.

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: web-server-node-port
  
spec:
  type: NodePort
  
  # port       : Port exposed for another k8s object inside our application (Internal listen port, for other k8s objects)
  # targetPort : Port targeted by this NodePort service (The origin-server port for this service)
  # nodePort   : Port exposed for outside world (External listen port, for outside world like browser)
  #              If not specified a random port in range 30000-32000 is assigned
  ports: 
    - port: 3050
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 31515

  # This service is associated with object(s). 
  # Which one(es)? -- All those having the key:value pairs 'component:web'
  selector:
    component: web
```

## Why Services?

We were able to access the app using http://192.168.39.190:31515/index.html . We figured the IP of k8s node from minikube. Port 31515 is the port exposed for outside world. 

- A k8s node could be running several pods and each pod will have its own IP.
- The service abstracts the access to the pod. That is, even if a pod goes down and is automatically recreated giving it a new IP, the service will still be able to find and route requests to this newly created pod.

```bash
> minikube ip
192.168.39.190

> > kubectl get services
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE

```

# Deployment -- The declarative approach

A Deployment is a K8s object that **monitors** and **maintains** (ensure right number exist and are up and running) a set of **identical** pods (same config). 

- We operate at the granularity of pods mostly during dev. In production, we deal with deployment as it is easier to manage a set of pods.
- A development monitors the stage of each pod and updates as necessary. Any failed pod shall be restarted/recreated.

```bash
##
# Apply
# -----
#  - Apply says created which means new pod was created.
##
> kubectl apply -f web-server-deployment.yaml 
deployment.apps/web-server-deployment created

##
# Get status of the object
# ------------------------
# NOTE: The get command gets the status of a k8s "object". So, we can say get "deployments". 
#       Remember "Deployement" is a kind of k8s object.
##
> kubectl get pods

web-server-deployment   1/1     1            1           25m
```

```bash

   # Number of identical pods to be maintained (using below template)

## Update image

### Deployment won't do anything deployment configuration file remains same

Lets say the `raghubs81/multi-web-server` needs some changes. We made the changes and pushed it to docker-hub as follows.

```bash
# Update the contents of the image (multi-web-server) and push it to docker-hub
> cd ~/GitP/Learn/Docker/L04_MutliContainer/web-server
> docker build -t raghubs81/multi-web-server .
> docker login -u raghubs81
> docker push raghubs81/multi-web-server

# Try to update all pods to use this updated new image from the docker-hub
> cd ~/GitProjects/Learn/Docker/L05_SimpleK8s
> kubectl apply -f web-server-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/web-server-deployment unchanged
```

All pods will continue to run with **old** image since the file `web-server-deployment.yaml` is unaltered. The underlying contents of the image are updated. In essence, if we update the image and tag it with the same tag (Default tag is 'latest') k8s thinks there is no change and hence does nothing.

> The tag 'latest' is just like any other  'foo' tag. The latest does NOT necessarily point the the most recent image! Any image can be tagged 'latest' just like any image can be tagged 'foo'.



### Workarounds for updating pods with new image

- We make code changes to the image
- We push the code changes to git
- The TravisCI picks the changes from git, builds the image and pushes to docker-hub
  - Now we need to make travis tag this image with a new tag (say v1, This can be done by updating travis.yml)
  - Otherwise, kubectl cannot differentiate this image from the previous (since the `web-server-deployment.yaml` file looks the same.)
- We now have to update the `web-server-deployment.yaml` to use the same version (v1)
- run `kubectl apply -f web-server-deployment.yaml`



### Using `kubectl set` (imperative command) to update image

```bash
# Kubectl set syntax
kubectl set image <object_type>/<object_name> <container_name>=<new_image_to_use>
```

See `web-server-deployment.yaml` for above details.

```bash
# Build with a version tag
> docker build -t raghubs81/multi-web-server:v4 .
...
Successfully tagged raghubs81/multi-web-server:v4

> docker push raghubs81/multi-web-server:v4 

> kubectl set image deployment/web-server-deployment client=raghubs81/multi-web-server:v4
deployment.apps/web-server-deployment image updated

> minikube ip 
192.168.39.190

# Access http://192.168.39.190:31515/index.html to ensure the changes are reflected.
```



## Clean up k8s environment

K8s environment consists of objects like pods, deployments and services. Types of service objects thus far include CluserIP (and NodePort).

A k8s object is deleted using the command `kubectl delete <object_type> <object_name> `

```bash
> kubectl get services
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE

# Pointing docker client to different server

By default docker client (The executable `docker`) tries to connect to the server (docker daemon) running on the same box.

```bash
> ps -ef | grep docker
root      1332     1  0 09:01 ?        00:00:43 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

However, to debug another node, we may want to connect to the corresponding docker server. In case of minikube run the following command.

```bash
> minikube docker-env
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.39.190:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/home/raghu/.minikube/certs"
export MINIKUBE_ACTIVE_DOCKERD="minikube"

# To point your shell to minikube's docker-daemon, run:
# eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
```
