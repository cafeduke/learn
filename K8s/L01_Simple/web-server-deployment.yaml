# apiVersion specifies the version number adhered by the config. Each version defines a set of k8s objects that are valid for the said version.
apiVersion: apps/v1

# The kind of K8s object is 'Deployment'
kind: Deployment

metadata:
  name: web-server-deployment

spec:
  # Number of identical pods to be maintained (using below template)
  replicas: 2

  # A Deployment does not create pods by itself -- It informs the k8s master
  # The master creates the pods, but the Deployment needs a handle on the pods thus created -- Hence the 'selector'
  # In essence this Deployment manages all objects with label (tag) 'component:web'
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: web

  # The template configuration to be used for every pod created by this deployment
  #  - The contents of the template section is similar to Pod. (Pod has similar metadata and spec sub sections)
  # Every pod that is created using this deployment shall have
  #  - A label (tag) 'component:web' (Label is how pods are picked. Note that a pod can have multiple labels/tags)
  #  - An image specified by the image attrib
